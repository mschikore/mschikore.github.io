    <h1>I Love cats!</h1>

    <p>
      My cat is the best thing ever.  His name is Bob.
      That was my dad's name too.  I think it was a sign.
      Just like my dad, my cat Bob is sweet, nice, and
      great company.  He also gets his needs met.  He loves
      to be petted and so he'll just jam his head into your
      hand repeatedly or rub against you.
